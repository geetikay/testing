#programming paradigm = style of programming
    #Python supports procedural programming, functional programming, and object oriented programming
        #procedural programming = splits instructions into procedures (proedures, unlike functions, do not have any desired resulting value; they simply accomplish a certain task)
        #functional programming = execution of a series of mathematical functions (do not modify and are not affected by outside values)
        #object-oriented programming = based on objects, which contain data

#print is one of the Python functions, place text you want printed inside ()
#When printing strings, use either double or single quotations but stay consistent 
print ("Hello World")
print ('Hello World')

#string = text (Python type), ex: "Hello World"

#Use the print function for calculations
#Do not use quotation marks for numbers
print (1+2)
print (7*6)
#exponentiation
print (4**2)
#modulo gives remainder
print (18%7)
print ()
print ("The end")

#When calling a function, must use () after function is named

#Can print several strings + numbers at once, using commas to separate arguments
print ("The end", "or is it", "keep watching to learn more about Python", 3)
